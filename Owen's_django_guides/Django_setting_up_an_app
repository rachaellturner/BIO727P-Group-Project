# in /src folder create an app, eg 'restaurants'
python3 manage.py startapp "restaurants"

# add:
# to views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse
# to urls.py
from django.conf.urls import url

# function based view:
# in views.py you can define functions that handle html requests

def home(request):
    #return a response
    return # response
    # eg
    return render(request, "template",{})
    # or an http response
    return HttpResponse("Hello")


# we need to put this view into a URL
# open urls.py in your project folder
# add
from restaurants.views import home
# this looks for the 'home' function we just wrote

# add to urlpatterns
url(r'$', home),

# make a templates folder in the project folder to hold html files

# make a file called base.html
# views.py can talk to this html file


# in base.py (in settings folder)
# change 
'DIRS': [],
# to
'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
# this points to the templates folder


## create new pages ##

# each view function can be assigned a url
# say we have functions called home, news, and trivia
# in urls.py:
# change
from restaurants.views import home
# to
from restaurants.views import home, news, trivia

# add to urlpatterns:
url(r'^home/$', home),
url(r'^random_numbers$', random_numbers),
url(r'^news$', news),
url(r'^trivia$', trivia),

# each view can use a different template
random_numbers.html
news.html
trivia.html
